# python_class1

1/ In Python, write a "Sum" class with two variables "n1" and "n2" and a member function "som()" that calculates the sum. In the main main method, ask the user to enter two integers and pass them to the default constructor of the "Sum" class, then display the result of adding the two numbers.

2/  Write a Python class called "Student" with the following members:
name: (of type char),
note1, note2 : (of type float)
calc_moy() : calculates the average grade.
afficher (): displays name and average grade.
The main program asks the user to enter a student's name and grades, and displays their name and average grade.

3/ Write a program in Python that simulates the management of a simple bank account. The account is created with an initial balance. It is possible to deposit and withdraw funds, add interest and find out the current balance. This should be implemented in a class named Account which includes:
1) A default constructor that sets the initial balance to zero.
2) A constructor that accepts an initial balance as a parameter.
3) A getBalance function that returns the current balance.
4) A deposit method to deposit a specified amount.
5) A withdraw method to withdraw a specified amount.
6) An add_Interest method to add interest to the account.
The add_Interest method takes the interest rate as a parameter and modifies the account balance to balance * (1 + interest rate).
